I applied K-Means clustering on Facebook Live Sellers data to group posts based on engagement metrics. Preprocessing techniques included Label Encoding and Standardization (using StandardScaler for numerical features). Using the Elbow Method, we determined the optimal number of clusters, trained the model, and visualized clusters and centroids.

I built a linear regression model to predict sales based on ad expenditures. The goal of the project was to analyze the impact of different advertising mediums (TV, Radio, Newspaper) on Sales. I used Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).

The second project involves analyzing and predicting the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning techniques. The primary goal of the project is to build a predictive model that can classify wine quality based on features such as acidity, sugar content, alcohol level, and other chemical properties.
